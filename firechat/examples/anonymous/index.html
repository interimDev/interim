    Example: Anonymous Authentication

    This example uses Firebase Simple Login to create "anonymous" user sessions in Firebase,
    meaning that user credentials are not required, though a user has a valid Firebase
    authentication token and security rules still apply.

    Requirements: in order to use this example with your own Firebase, you'll need to do the following:
      1. Apply the security rules at https://github.com/firebase/firechat/blob/master/rules.json
      2. Enable the "Anonymous" authentication provider in Forge
      3. Update the URL below to reference your Firebase
      4. Update the room id for auto-entry with a public room you have created

    <div id="firechat-wrapper"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      var chatRef = new Firebase("https://interim.firebaseio.com");
      var chat = new FirechatUI(chatRef, document.getElementById("firechat-wrapper"));
      //This sets up the anonymous chat
      chatRef.onAuth(function(authData) {
        if (authData) {
          chat.setUser(authData.uid, authData.uid.substr(10, 8));
        } else {
          chatRef.authAnonymously(function(error, authData) {
            if (error) {
              console.log(error);
            }
          });
        }
      });
    </script>
